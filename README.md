# Silent Payments

A rust implementation of BIP352: Silent Payments.

## About

**Warning: this crate is still new and is my first project doing elliptic curve cryptography!
Even though it passes the tests provided in the official silent payments BIP,
review it carefully before using this with mainnet funds.**

This library supports creating and sending to silent payment addresses,
building on [`secp256k1`](https://docs.rs/secp256k1/latest/secp256k1)
`PublicKey` and `SecretKey` structs for the interface.

There are two parts to this library: a sender part and a recipient part.

## Sender

For sending to a silent payment address, you can call the `sender::generate_recipient_pubkeys` function.
This function takes a `recipient: Vec<String>` as an argument, where the `String` is a bech32m encoded silent payment address (`sp1q...` or `tsp1q...`).

This function additionally takes a `ecdh_shared_secrets: HashMap<PublicKey, PublicKey>` argument, which maps a Spend key to a shared secret.
Since this shared secret derivation requires secret data, this library expects the user to provide the pre-computed result.

See the `tests/vector_tests.rs` and `tests/common/utils.rs` files for an example of how to compute the shared secrets.

## Recipient

For receiving silent payments. We have use a struct called `recipient::SilentPayment`.
After creating this struct with a spending and scanning secret key,
you can call the `scan_transaction` function to look for any outputs in a transaction belonging to you.

The library also supports labels. You can optionally add labels before scanning by using the `add_label` function.

## Tests

The `tests/resources` folder contains a copy of the test vectors as of January 24th 2024.

You can test the code using the test vectors by running `cargo test`.
