# Silent Payments

This repo is a rust implementation of BIP352: Silent Payments.
This BIP is still under development, and this repo is by no means ready for real use yet.
At this point, the repo is no more than a rust rewrite of the `reference.py` python reference implementation.

The `tests/resources` folder contains a copy of the test vectors as of August 4th 2023.

You can test the code using the test vectors by running `cargo test`
